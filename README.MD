# MSCS532 Assignment 6

* Part 1: Implementation and analysis of Randomized Select and Median-of-Medians Select algorithms.
* Part 2: Implementation of basic data structures.

## Part 1: Selection Algorithms

This part focuses on the implementation and performance comparison of two selection algorithms:
- **Randomized Select:** An algorithm that finds the i-th smallest element in an unordered list in expected linear time.
- **Median-of-Medians Select:** An algorithm that finds the i-th smallest element in an unordered list in guaranteed linear time.

For more details, please see the [Part 1 README](./Part1/README.md).

## Part 2: Data Structures

This part involves the implementation of fundamental data structures:
- Arrays and Matrices
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues

For more details, please see the [Part 2 README](./Part2/README.MD).
